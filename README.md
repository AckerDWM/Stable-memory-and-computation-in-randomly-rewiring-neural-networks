Simulation code and supplementary materials related to the paper "Stable memory and computation in randomly rewiring neural networks"
by Daniel Acker, Suzanne Paradis, and Paul Miller.

The provided code is sufficient to reproduce key findings related to models one and two, which simulate place cell receptive field stability as synaptic connections from grid cells are rearranged.

To perform simulations and generate summary visualizations, source the scripts `model-1.R` and `model-2.R` in the top level directory of the repo.
